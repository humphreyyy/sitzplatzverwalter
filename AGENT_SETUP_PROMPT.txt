- Undo/Redo buttons in toolbar

Dittmann color scheme (use these exact colors):
- Primary Blue: #1e3a5f

- Light Blue: #a8c5dd
- Rooms: #e8f4f8
- Seat Free: #c8e6c9

All UI text MUST be in German.

Guidelines:
- Use config.py for all constants and colors
- Implement responsive layouts
- Handle window resize gracefully
