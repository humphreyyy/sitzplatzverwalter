# Sitzplatz-Manager - Project Context for Claude

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31 (Phase 6 Complete - macOS Deployment Ready | Floorplan UX Enhanced)

## Project Overview

**Name:** Sitzplatz-Manager

**Description:** Desktop application for managing student seating assignments in a classroom with visual floorplan editor

**Purpose:** Help teachers/administrators organize and automate student seating arrangements with support for:
- Weekly attendance patterns
- Automatic intelligent assignment
- Manual override capability
- Multi-user collaboration with file locking
- PDF export of seating plans

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.9+
- **GUI Framework:** Tkinter (built-in, cross-platform)
- **Image Processing:** Pillow
- **PDF Generation:** ReportLab
- **Packaging:** py2app (for macOS .app bundles)
- **Data Storage:** JSON files
- **Concurrency:** File-based locking mechanism

## Architecture Type

**Three-Layer Modular Architecture:**
- **Data Layer** (data/): JSON I/O, file locking, undo/redo
- **Logic Layer** (logic/): Business rules, assignment algorithm, validation
- **GUI Layer** (gui/): Tkinter user interface

## Project Structure

```
sitzplatzverwalter/
â”œâ”€â”€ gui/                    # Tkinter GUI components
â”œâ”€â”€ logic/                  # Business logic and algorithms
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                   # Data access and persistence
â”œâ”€â”€ models/                 # Data model definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py              # Configuration and constants
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                # Application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ data.json              # Application data (runtime)
â”œâ”€â”€ data.lock              # Multi-user lock file
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/                # Static resources (images)
â””â”€â”€ backups/               # Automatic backup directory
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns:** Clear boundaries between UI, logic, and data enable independent testing and maintenance

2. **File-Based Architecture:** Uses JSON + file locking for simplicity, network drive compatibility, and easy backups

3. **Assignment Algorithm:** Priority-based: previous seat holders â†’ requirement matches â†’ alphabetical order

4. **Undo/Redo:** Stack-based with max 50 states, memory-bounded

5. **Multi-User Support:** File lock mechanism with 1-hour timeout, automatic stale lock detection

6. **German UI:** All user-facing text in German, consistent with Dittmann brand colors

## Coding Conventions

### Python Style
- **Type Hints:** All function signatures must include type hints
- **Docstrings:** Public methods and classes require docstrings
- **Dataclasses:** Use `@dataclass` for all model definitions in models/
- **Naming:** snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes
- **Constants:** SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE in config.py

### UI/UX
- **Language:** German only, all menus/buttons/dialogs
- **Colors:** Dittmann brand colors
  - `#1e3a5f` (Dark blue, primary)
  - `#e31e24` (Red, accent)
  - `#a8c5dd` (Light blue, secondary)
- **Status Colors:** Green (free), Yellow (occupied), Red (conflict)
- **Fonts:** System default, readable sans-serif

### Data Organization
- **Models Location:** `models/` directory, one class per file
- **Configuration:** Centralized in `config.py`
- **JSON Keys:** snake_case (not camelCase)
- **Dates:** ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Timestamps:** ISO 8601 with timezone (UTC)

## Data File Schemas

### data.json
Contains complete application state: floorplan (rooms + seats), students, and assignments by week/day.

Example structure:
```json
{
  "metadata": {...},
  "floorplan": {
    "rooms": [...],
    "seats": [...]
  },
  "students": [...],
  "assignments": {
    "2025-W43": {
      "monday": [{"student_id": "...", "seat_id": "..."}],
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

### data.lock
Multi-user lock file, prevents concurrent modifications.

Example:
```json
{
  "locked": true,
  "user": "admin@PC-01",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-31T14:30:00Z",
  "pid": 12345,
  "hostname": "PC-01"
}
```

See ARCHITECTURE.md for complete schemas and examples.

## Assignment Algorithm Overview

**Priority-based automatic seating:**
1. Get students available on that day
2. Get free seats
3. Sort students: previous seat holders first, then alphabetically
4. For each student, try to assign:
   - Previous seat first (if available)
   - Requirement-matching seat (if has requirements)
   - Any free seat (fallback)
5. Track and report conflicts (unassigned students)

See ARCHITECTURE.md section 6 for pseudocode and detailed implementation guide.

## Multi-User File Locking

**Lock Mechanism:**
- Lock file: `data.lock` in project root
- Acquired on app startup, released on close/save
- Timeout: 1 hour (automatic stale lock removal)
- Read-only mode: If file is locked by another user

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Stale locks from crashed processes
- Lock file corruption
- Multi-user concurrent access
- Network drive delays

See ARCHITECTURE.md section 7 for complete details.

## Floorplan Editor Enhancements

**Enhanced FloorplanTab with professional visual editing features:**

### Background Image Display
- Loads `assets/Grundriss.png` (classroom floorplan image) as canvas background
- Automatically scales to fit canvas while maintaining aspect ratio
- Graceful degradation if image not found
- Image integrated seamlessly with room/seat overlays

### Drag-to-Create Room Functionality
- **Mode Toggle Button:** Switch between "AuswÃ¤hlen" (Select) and "Raum zeichnen" (Draw Room) modes
- **In Draw Mode:**
  - Drag rectangle on canvas to create preview (dashed outline in accent red)
  - Release mouse to complete room creation
  - Dialog prompts for room name
  - Minimum size validation (30Ã—30 pixels)
  - Automatic positioning and sizing from drag coordinates
- **In Select Mode:**
  - Move existing rooms and seats by dragging
  - Right-click for delete/properties context menu
  - Cursor feedback: hand icon when hovering over objects

### UI/UX Improvements
- Mode button with visual feedback (dark blue in Select, red in Draw)
- Smart cursor changes: arrow â†’ crosshair â†’ hand depending on mode/context
- Improved toolbar layout with visual separators
- Better button styling for macOS compatibility
- German labels: "AuswÃ¤hlen" (Select), "Raum zeichnen" (Draw Room)
- Status bar updates showing current mode

### Configuration
**New constants in config.py:**
```python
MODE_SELECT = "select"              # Select/move existing objects
MODE_DRAW_ROOM = "draw_room"        # Draw new rooms by dragging
FLOORPLAN_IMAGE = "Grundriss.png"   # Floorplan background image
```

**New UI texts (German):**
```python
"select_mode": "AuswÃ¤hlen",
"draw_room_mode": "Raum zeichnen",
```
