# Phase 3 Implementation Summary

**Project:** Sitzplatz-Manager
**Phase:** 3 - Business Logic Implementation
**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE
**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Duration:** 90 minutes (vs. 2 hours estimated)

---

## Overview

Phase 3 successfully implements the complete business logic layer for the Sitzplatz-Manager application, including the core seat assignment algorithm, business rule validation, and PDF export functionality. All modules are fully tested and integrate seamlessly with the Phase 2 data layer.

---

## Components Implemented

### 1. Validator (`logic/validator.py`)

**Purpose:** Business rule validation and conflict detection

**Key Methods:**
- `validate_room_overlap(rooms)` - Detects overlapping room boundaries
- `validate_seat_in_room(seat, room)` - Verifies seat is within room bounds
- `validate_capacity(students, seats, day)` - Checks for overbooking on specific day
- `validate_student_date_range(student)` - Validates date range consistency
- `validate_assignment_conflicts(assignments)` - Detects double-booking conflicts
- `validate_all_seats_in_rooms(seats, rooms)` - Batch validation for all seats

**Features:**
- Rectangle intersection detection for room overlaps
- Point-in-rectangle testing for seat positioning
- Day-specific capacity calculation
- ISO date format validation with "ongoing" support
- Duplicate seat and student assignment detection
- Comprehensive conflict reporting with details

**Lines of Code:** 210
**Unit Tests:** 25 (100% passing)

---

### 2. AssignmentEngine (`logic/assignment_engine.py`)

**Purpose:** Core intelligent seat assignment algorithm

**Key Methods:**
- `assign_week(students, seats, week, previous_assignments)` - Assigns entire week
- `assign_day(students, seats, day, week, previous_assignments)` - Assigns single day
- `get_priority_sort_key(student, prev_assignment_map)` - Determines student priority
- `find_seat_for_student(student, available_seats, previous_seat)` - Finds best matching seat
- `get_assignment_statistics(assignments, conflicts, students, seats)` - Calculates metrics

**Algorithm Implementation (per ARCHITECTURE.md §6):**

1. **Student Prioritization:**
   - Students with previous seats get priority (continuity)
   - Within priority level, sorted alphabetically by name
   - Ensures fair and consistent assignment

2. **Seat Selection Strategy:**
   ```
   Priority order for each student:
   1. Previous seat (if available) → maintains continuity
   2. Seat matching ALL requirements → perfect match
   3. Seat matching SOME requirements → partial match (best effort)
   4. Any available seat → fallback
   ```

3. **Conflict Tracking:**
   - Students who cannot be assigned are tracked as conflicts
   - Overbooking scenarios handled gracefully
   - Day-by-day conflict reporting

4. **Weekly Assignment:**
   - Processes all 7 days (Monday-Sunday)
   - Uses previous week's assignments for continuity
   - Independent day-by-day processing

**Statistics Calculated:**
- Total assignments across all days
- Total conflicts (unassigned students)
- Seat occupancy rate (percentage)
- Days with conflicts
- Conflict rate (percentage of student-days)

**Lines of Code:** 270
**Unit Tests:** 19 (100% passing)

---

### 3. PdfExporter (`logic/pdf_exporter.py`)

**Purpose:** Professional PDF report generation

**Key Methods:**
- `export_week_to_pdf(week, assignments, students, seats, statistics)` - Main export
- `save_pdf_to_file(pdf_content, filename)` - Save PDF to disk
- `is_available()` - Check if ReportLab is installed

**PDF Report Structure:**
1. **Title Page:** Week identifier (e.g., "Woche 2025-W43")
2. **Daily Tables:** One table per day showing:
   - Seat number (Sitzplatz)
   - Student name (Student)
   - Room ID (Raum)
   - Alternating row colors for readability
3. **Statistics Page:** Summary metrics table with:
   - Total assignments (Gesamtzuweisungen)
   - Conflicts (Konflikte)
   - Occupancy rate (Auslastung)
   - Days with conflicts (Tage mit Konflikten)
   - Conflict rate (Konfliktrate)
   - Student/seat counts
4. **Footer:** Generation timestamp

**Features:**
- Dittmann brand colors (#1e3a5f blue, professional styling)
- German language throughout (Sitzplatz, Montag, Dienstag, etc.)
- Handles German umlauts correctly (Müller, Schröder, etc.)
- Graceful degradation when students/seats missing from lookup
- Empty day handling ("Keine Zuteilungen für diesen Tag")
- A4 page size with proper margins
- Professional table styling with alternating row colors

**Error Handling:**
- ImportError with helpful message when ReportLab not installed
- Availability check before attempting PDF generation
- IOError handling for file write operations

**Lines of Code:** 240
**Unit Tests:** 12 (11 passing, 1 skipped conditionally)

# Assign entire week
assignments, conflicts = AssignmentEngine.assign_week(
    students=all_students,
    seats=all_seats,
    week="2025-W43",
    previous_assignments=last_week_assignments
)

# Get statistics
stats = AssignmentEngine.get_assignment_statistics(
    assignments=assignments,
    conflicts=conflicts,
    students=all_students,
    seats=all_seats
)
```

### Validation
```python
from logic.validator import Validator

# Check room overlaps
is_valid, conflicts = Validator.validate_room_overlap(rooms)

# Check capacity
is_valid, details = Validator.validate_capacity(students, seats, "monday")
```

### PDF Export
```python
from logic.pdf_exporter import PdfExporter

# Generate PDF
pdf_bytes = PdfExporter.export_week_to_pdf(
    week="2025-W43",
    assignments=assignments,
    students=students,
    seats=seats,
    statistics=stats
)

# Save to file
PdfExporter.save_pdf_to_file(pdf_bytes, "sitzplan_2025_W43.pdf")
```
