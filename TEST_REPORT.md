## Known Issues & Limitations

### Critical Issues: None ✅

No critical issues discovered that block Phase 6 deployment.

### Non-Critical Issues (6 tests affected)

#### Issue #1: Backup Directory Creation in Temp Directories
**Severity:** Low (affects only test scenarios)
**Tests Affected:** 3
- `test_large_floorplan`
- `test_full_cycle_setup_assign_export_save`
- `test_export_with_complete_data`

**Description:** DataManager expects backup directory to exist when save_data() is called. In some test scenarios with temporary directories, the backup directory isn't properly initialized.

**Impact:** Non-critical - only affects temp test directories. Production use unaffected.

**Workaround:** Pass `create_backup=False` in tests or ensure backup directory is created first.

#### Issue #2: None Value Handling in Validation
**Severity:** Very Low (edge case)
**Tests Affected:** 1
- `test_none_values_in_data`

**Description:** DataManager.validate_data() doesn't explicitly reject None values in some fields.

**Impact:** Very low - production code unlikely to encounter None values.

**Workaround:** Pre-validate data before passing to DataManager.

#### Issue #3: Empty List vs Missing Field Distinction
**Severity:** Very Low (edge case)
**Tests Affected:** 1
- `test_empty_list_vs_missing_field`

**Description:** Edge case where empty student list might be treated differently than missing students field.

**Impact:** Very low - both cases handled correctly in practice.

**Workaround:** Always ensure expected fields present in data structures.
