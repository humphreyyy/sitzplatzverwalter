## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 Architecture Decisions
- **Three-Layer Architecture:** Clear separation (GUI/Logic/Data) for testability
- **JSON + File Locking:** Simple, compatible with network drives
- **Dataclasses for Models:** Type hints + lightweight syntax
- **German UI:** All text in German with Dittmann colors
- **Priority-Based Assignment:** Intelligent seating based on preferences
- **File-Based Undo/Redo:** Bounded memory usage (50 states max)

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Follow ARCHITECTURE.md exactly** - Don't deviate without updating spec first
2. **Use type hints on all functions** - Enables better IDE support and safety
3. **Test incrementally** - After each layer completes
4. **Use /clear between phases** - Saves tokens, resets context
5. **Update PROGRESS.md after each phase** - Maintains visibility

### Known Constraints
- No database backend (JSON only)
- Single-file locking (not transaction-based)
- Tkinter only (limited styling options)
- Python 3.9+ required
- Network drive compatibility depends on file system

### Risk Mitigation
- **Stale Locks:** 1-hour timeout with auto-cleanup
- **Data Loss:** Automatic backups before each save
- **Concurrent Edits:** File-based locking prevents simultaneous writes
- **Memory Issues:** Bounded undo stack (50 states)
- **Missing Assets:** Graceful degradation if grundriss.png missing

## Next Actions

**Phase 2 starts when Phase 1 is verified complete:**
1. Create models/ directory
2. Implement all dataclasses with type hints
3. Implement DataManager for JSON I/O
4. Implement LockManager for multi-user support
5. Implement UndoManager for undo/redo
6. Write unit tests for data layer

**Phase 2 Command:**
```
Use the data-impl sub-agent to implement the data layer according to ARCHITECTURE.md.
Follow exactly the specifications for models, JSON I/O, locking, and undo/redo.
```

## Progress Tracking

Each phase should update this file immediately upon completion:
- Mark phase checkbox as complete: `[x]`
- Record actual duration vs estimated
- Document any deviations from plan
- Note blockers or issues encountered
- Update next phase estimate if needed

**Phase updates are CRITICAL for maintaining project visibility across contexts.**
